<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: white;">Analysis
and visualization of mass
spectrometry imaging (MSI) data is
often based on selected subsets of the data, e.g., single or multiple
spectra or m/z data slices. It is, therefore, crucial that we are able
to quickly access select subsets of the data. In the context of
web-based applications —such as the OpenMSI Viewer— this is
particularly crucial in order to enable interactive data analysis and
to provide a satisfactory user experience. One focus in development of
the OpenMSI file format has been to characterizing and optimize the
performance of data access operations performed in serial and parallel
on OMSI HDF5 files. All optimizations are implemented transparently in
HDF5, i.e, the optimizations are defined via a single function call to
set up the layout and dataset properties prior to writing the data
while the actual read/write of the data do not change. </span><span

</span><span style="color: white;">Many
application use
traditional flat binary formats to store MSI data. In such formats, the
MSI data data is typically stored one-spectrum-at-a-time in a contiguous
block of data. Using this strategy does not allow for optimization of
orthogonal data access. E.g, access to single spectra is very efficient
while access to a single m/z data slice requires traversal of the full
data volume.</span><br style="color: white;">
<br style="color: white;">
<span style="color: white;">In contrast to storing the data
in a single block in the HDF5 file,
using chunking the data is split into multiple chunks. Each chunk of a
dataset is allocated separately and stored at independent locations
throughout the HDF5 file. The chunks of a dataset can then be written
and read independently enabling independent parallel I/O and
potentially improving performance of partial I/O operations required
when operating on subsets of the data.</span><br style="color: white;">
<br style="color: white;">
<span style="color: white;">To illustrate the overall
performance of the different dataset layouts and to identify the “best”
layouts, we defined a set of&nbsp; the of minimum performance criteria
a data layout should fulfill. The results of the performance score are
summarized in the figure above. A detailed discussion of the file
format performance is available as part of the</span> <a

style="color: white;">Use
of chunking also enables the use of HDF5 I/O filters. We here
investigated the use of compression filters. I/O filters are applied in
HDF5 to each chunk individually, and entire chunks are compressed at
once. The compression and decompression of the data is handled
transparently by the HDF5 library, so that the user can use the data in
the same way independent of whether chunking and compression are
enabled or not. The figure shown on the lefts presents a summary of compression
results for a diverse set of MSI datasets. A more detailed discussion of
the use of compression is available as part of the </span> <a

<div style="text-align: justify;">The goal of the local peak finding it to
classify each spectrum (one per pixel) to find all main peaks in the
spectrum. Classification of the spectra is important for further
analyses of the spectra, e.g., data clustering. Traditionally peak
finding is performed in serial, one spectrum at a time. During the peak
finding, each spectrum is processed independently. s part of the
OpenMSI effort we investigated the of GPU's to accelerate the peak
finding process by processing multiple spectra in parallel.&nbsp; Even
for small MSI datasets, processing all spectra often requires several
hours (e.g., ~6h for a 227 x 108 x 63387 dataset) and may require
several days for medium sized datasets. Using our GPU-based peak
finding algorithm we are able to complete the analysis in just a few
minutes. Processing of a dataset with a resolution of 227 x 108 x 63378
(1.2GB) required only ~117 seconds and processing of a larger 160 x 250
x 116152 (9.3GB) dataset required only ~697 seconds.<br>
