<!-- OpenMSI (2).png: looks fine to me, we just need to add the individual content. If we want we could optionally add a "What is OpenMSI" section to the bottom of this page in which we could elaborate in more detail on the vision of OpenMSI (think of something along the lines of a press release). This would allow us to keep the main page very compact and link to this page for more details. I would call this page the About page in the menu. -->

            <p>Berkeley Lab provides OpenMSI as a public service. This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data by OpenMSI in relation to your use of the website openmsi.nersc.gov (“Website and Application Services”). When we use the term “personal data” in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that would allow someone to identify you, such as your name, address, location, employer, email address or other unique identifier. </p>
            <h3>Collection of personal data</h3>
            <p>You are not required to register to use the OpenMSI Website and Application Services, but registration enables enhanced features, which can greatly improve the usefulness of the site. When you register, we will collect information about your affiliation. This helps us to obtain funding and target our tools to the needs of our users. We also collect an email address that we will use to identify your profile. This allows you to review previous work and control sharing of data. OpenMSI uses the NERSC Information Management (NIM) system for user registration and users must adhere to the NERSC Electronic Computer Use Agreement as part of the user registraion. When you use the OpenMSI Website and Application Services, whether you log in as a registered user or not, our servers will automatically collect the following information: your IP address (which may be used to indicate your general location), your browser type and version, date and time of the visit, and the pages that you view on openmsi.nersc.gov. Additionally we also monitor and log all activity on the site, including any selections generated by you. By default all data will not be visible to the public unless the user explicitly designates them to be so.</p>
            <h3>Use of personal data</h3>
            <p>We use the personal data we collect for internal purposes only––for example, to help us measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our site and improve organization, coverage, system performance or problem areas. This information is not used for associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. On occasion, OpenMSI may use aggregated personal data information for the purposes of analysis of the webpage usage. Aggregated data cannot be linked back to an individual user. We also use Google Analytics to help us collect and analyze this personal data as discussed further below. We will never sell or rent your personal data, and we do not link browsing information or personal data from our server logs to any other personal data that you might submit to us, for example as a registered user of OpenMSI.</p>

            <h3>Disclosure of personal data</h3>
            <p>OpenMSI does not sell or rent your data to any third parties. OpenMSI may disclose your personal data to contractors and service providers only if and in so far as this is necessary for technical administration and maintenance of the Services, and in accordance with applicable law. We may also disclose your personal data to third parties if you explicitly consent to it, or if we are required to do so by applicable law.</p>

            <p>OpenMSI is being supervised by The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (“LBNL”,or "Berkeley Lab") and adheres to the cybersecurity standards enforced by the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) for all its systems. Berkeley Lab operates an integrated set of cybersecurity protections designed to efficiently protect research and operational data while enabling cutting edge research. LBNL's systems are Certified and Accredited under NIST 800-53 and have Authority to Operate from the Department of Energy. LBNL's information protection systems include advanced intrusion detection systems, deep forensic logging, vulnerability detection and remediation, and configuration management.

LBNL constantly adjusts its protections to changing risks and threats with the goal of optimally protecting scientific work.</p>

            <p>Causing damage to federal computer systems is a violation of U.S. law and is subject to criminal prosecution in federal court.
